Hiya! This is a collection of projects I did for my advanced computer graphics course. The contents are as follows:

### Labs:
- Lab 1: a 2d mockup of getting a group of boids to flock in Processing (https://processing.org/)
- Lab 2: I built a simple model of a bee in Maya to be used in my larger Flocking simulation project (Projects 1)
- Lab 3: Test renders of some PBRT files. PBRT can be found here: https://www.pbrt.org/
- Lab 4: made custom scenes and objects to be rendered in PBRT.
- Lab 5: an exploration of procedural synthesis of geometry (specifically L-systems) utilizing Houdini.
- Lab 6: rendering a mandelbrot (2D) in Houdini.
- Lab 7: rendering a mandelbulb (3D) in Houdini.

### Projects:
- Project 1: built a fully 3D boid flocking simulator in OpenFrameworks using C++.
- Project 2: modified the source code of PBRT to be a Raymarcher, rendering physical objects by using SDF (signed distance field) functions. This allows the rendering of procedurally generated (via mathematical functions) topologies. I used this to render a scene using perlin noise but it can also be used for fractals or other mathematically complex topologies.
- Final Project: created a 3D procedural world map generator with moving bodies of water in OpenFrameworks. Perlin noise was a key component of the generation.
